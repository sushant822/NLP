## Food Review Stop Words


In this project, we will make analyzing restaurant reviews making it a lot easier by removing all the stop words. These would be the steps to follow:

1. Tokenize the data and `transform` into a DataFrame.

2. Remove the stop words and `transform` into another DataFrame.

3. Show only the results of the column with the stop words removed.
